The automotive project incorporates various sensors to collect diverse information about cars. The project initially focuses on establishing communication with the SIM800L module. To retrieve data from cars, an OBD2 system is employed, utilizing the CAN bus to gather the required information. For tracking the location, a GPS system is utilized. Additionally, an MPU6050 sensor is employed to detect rotation, movement, and shock events.
